## Files
1. DatasetInformation.rtf: The following text file describes information about the dataset including where it was extracted from and how many images were inside the datset.
2. OutputImages-1.zip: Folder of images from dataset images to predicted outputs compared to actual output and metric tables like classification report and confusion matrix.
3. Part1_MaskDetector.ipynb: Main notebook where splitting, training, and evaluation of the model can be seen. The notebook is already ran so the outputs are already visible, should you want to run it again you must restart the kernel.
4. fileExtrator_MaskDetector.ipynb: Script used to extract the dataset, use unsupervised learning to cluster the dataset into proper folders, resized the image.
5. mask_detect_model.pth: The saved model that was trained on the dataset.
6. model_loader.ipynb: Following is a notebook with instructions on how to run the saved model on a sample dataset, along with a few of the metrics. Instructions are given at the top of the file.
7. test.zip: Following is sample data taken from the test set to be used to test imported model.

Talk about each file and its purpose, how to run our files etc. throw some evaluation pictures to make it look nice and complete.

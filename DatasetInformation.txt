The resolution of each image in each class is (32x32x3), this was done by applying a script to resize the images to the same size since the CNN can only accept the same sized input. The snippet of code can be found in the fileExtractor-MaskDetector.ipynb . The dataset was primarily from the first link and a few extra examples of N95 masks from the second dataset as it was lacking. The size of the entire dataset including individual classes can be found below.
SplitDataset: 8836 images

Test: 2654 images
No Mask: 1531 images
Cloth Mask: 427 images
N95 Mask: 166 images
Surgical Mask: 530 images

Train: 6182 images
No Mask: 3571 images
Cloth Mask: 993 images
N95 Mask: 384 images
Surgical Mask: 1234 images

The dataset was then uploaded to google drive so we can access the files without all of us having to download it along with Google Colab easy to use mount function to access the files in our drive.
